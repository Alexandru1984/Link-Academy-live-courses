    <p class="about">
      The very first Starbuzzz opened its doors in 1996. The Victoriei 60 was born from Marian's love for
      coffee and Daniela's love for the 'big city ritual' he encountered in New York and London.

      relaxed environment.

      together far too
      much, and are treated as an anonymous commodity on the futures market.

      compete for the main prizes while grinding, tamping, foaming and latte art. At a national level, baristas can
      regularly be
      found in the finals of the Barista Championship, NK Latte art and other competitions.
