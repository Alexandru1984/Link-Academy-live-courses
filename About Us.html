  <p class="about">
    The very first Coffeecompany opened its doors in 1996. The CC Leidsestraat 60 was born from KoffieDick's love for
    coffee
    and Rick's love for the 'big city ritual' he encountered in New York and London.

  <p class="about">
    In the following years, Coffeecompany conquered Amsterdam with locations such as the Helst, Haarlemmerdijk,
    Doelenstraat
    and Beethovenstraat. Coffeecompany seduced a new generation of coffee fans with the versatility of coffee in a
    relaxed
    environment.
  </p>

  <p class="about">
    There are now 35 branches in Amsterdam, The Hague, Utrecht, Groningen, Leiden, Rotterdam and Delft and a roasting /
    tasting room in Amsterdam. Each with a unique place in the neighborhood. There are regular performances and there is
    room on the wall for local designers and artists.
  </p>

  <p class="about">
    With Coffeecompany, Dick was able to substantiate his personal belief that coffee beans are lumped together far too
    much, and are treated as an anonymous commodity on the futures market. Due to direct contact with coffee farmers and
    the payment of prices in relation to the quality, Coffeecompany can have unique coffee according to its own recipe.
  </p>

  <p class="about">
    With purpose-built espresso machines and extensive barista training in the coffee warehouse in Amsterdam, brewing
    coffee
    at Coffeecompany is once again a craft. The CC Barista Cup has been held annually since 1998, where all baristas
    compete
    for the main prizes while grinding, tamping, foaming and latte art. At a national level, baristas can regularly be
    found
    in the finals of the Barista Championship, NK Latte art and other competitions.
  </p>

  <p class="about">
    Continuously looking for the tastiest coffees in the countries of origin, further developing knowledge in the field
    of roasting and final brewing, is what Coffeecompany does to help as many people as possible get better coffee.

    Coffeecompany is an independently operating company under the umbrella of Jacobs Douwe Egberts. The passion for and
    knowledge about coffee is shared back and forth.
